## [Coral Restoration Foundation](https://www.coralrestoration.org/)

Founded in response to the wide-spread loss of the dominant coral species on the Florida Reef Tract, The Coral Restoration Foundation™ is now the largest coral reef restoration organization in the world.

*"We are actively restoring coral reefs on a massive scale, educating others on the importance of our oceans, and using science to further coral research and coral reef monitoring techniques.  We work to support the reefs’ natural recovery processes through the large-scale cultivation, outplanting, and monitoring of genetically diverse, reef-building corals.  We engage and empower the community to join us to save our planet’s coral reefs with dive programs, educational activities, scientific collaborations, and outreach."*


## [Misool Foundation](https://www.misoolfoundation.org/)

Organization focused on protecting the Misool Marine Reserve: a 300,000-acre marine conservation area.  They also have a community education program and run the Misool Manta Ray Project.

*"Misool Foundation is the registered charity arm of the private island resort, Misool.  Based in Raja Ampat, Indonesia, our joint mission is to safeguard the most biodiverse reefs on Earth through the empowerment of local communities, providing a structure by which they are able to reclaim their traditional tenureship of reefs."*

*"At the core of our operation is the belief that sustainable tourism and community-based conservation are mutually beneficial.  We seek to demonstrate to our local hosts, government, guests, and ourselves that sustainable tourism can provide a better life than logging, mining, or overfishing."*

## [Reef Renewal Bonaire](https://www.reefrenewalbonaire.org/)

A non-profit organization working with and assisting Bonaire with their continued efforts to preserve Bonaire’s greatest assets, its coral reefs. The project centered on the restoration of the shallow reefs by establishing staghorn and elkhorn coral nurseries and restoration sites and still does today. Today, over 14,000 corals are grown in RRFB eight nurseries and over 30,900 corals have been outplanted back to Bonaire’s reefs.

*"The Mission of Reef Renewal Foundation Bonaire is to protect and restore coral reefs in Bonaire by developing new and innovative ways to restore reefs that are supported by research collaborations and shared worldwide. By training, engaging, and inspiring the community locally and internationally through volunteering, educational events, and outreach. By demonstrating that through community efforts there is still hope for coral reefs."*

## [Coral Vita](https://www.coralvita.co/)

Coral Vita grows corals in land-based farms by using microfragmenting - a process pioneered by the Mote Marine Laboratory  - to accelerate coral growth up to 50x natural rates. Many coral species that serve as critical building blocks for reefs (such as Brain or Great Star corals) grow too slowly to be feasible for restoration projects using ocean-based nurseries. Now, Coral Vita can grow these corals in months rather than decades.

## [Reef Restoration Foundation](https://reefrestorationfoundation.org/)
Not-for-profit group collaborating with successful coral restoration projects in Florida and the Caribbean to create the first Great Barrier Reef nursery near Cairns. 

*"We have successfully grown our first generation of corals and planted them on a nearby reef. In September 2019 we moved this nursery to a more accessible location at Fitzroy Island where there is room for expansion. We have expanded and added ten new trees and will work with a tourism operator to conduct tours of the nursery."*

## [Coral Reef Alliance](https://coral.org/)

A non-profit, environmental NGO that is on a mission to save the world’s coral reefs. Works collaboratively with communities to reduce direct threats to reefs in ways that provide long-term benefits to people and wildlife.

## [Reef Relief](https://www.reefrelief.org/)
A nonprofit membership organization dedicated to improving and protecting our coral reef ecosystem.

## [Ocean Gardener](https://oceangardener.org/)
Ocean Gardener is an NGO founded in 2016 dedicated to coral reef education. Created the first commercial coral mariculture farms in Indonesia to allow the coastal community a living out of their reefs.

# Aquaculture

## [Rising Tide Conservation] (https://www.risingtideconservation.org/)

Focuses on 
*"Rising Tide Conservation is dedicated to developing and promoting aquaculture of marine ornamental fish species through the collaborative efforts of researchers, public aquaria, hobbyists, pet industry professionals, and conservation groups. Rising Tide Conservation facilitates sustainability in the aquarium industry by supporting marine ornamental fish aquaculture research in order to reduce the impacts of wild fish collection on fish populations and the coral reefs where they live."*


# Marine Life

## [The Rob Stewart Sharkwater Foundation](https://www.robstewartsharkwaterfoundation.org/)
Organization focused on the conservation and protection of sharks.  Founded in memory of Rob Stewart, a biologist, conservationist, activist and filmmaker. Rob made three films in his career: Sharkwater, Revolution & Sharkwater Extinction.

*"It is our goal to inspire others to live their own dreams and make a difference by protecting sharks, our ecosystems and our oceans. Rob believed that: “Conservation is the preservation of human life on earth.  And that, above all else is worth fighting for.” Our mission is to create the tools required to engage others in educating our communities world wide."*

## [Oceana](https://oceana.org/)

Since its founding, Oceana has won more than 225 victories and protected nearly 4 million square miles of ocean. The Ocean Law Project — also initiated by The Pew Charitable Trusts — was absorbed into Oceana in 2001 as Oceana’s legal arm. In 2002, Oceana merged with American Oceans Campaign, founded by actor and environmentalist Ted Danson, to more effectively address our common mission of protecting and restoring the world’s oceans.

*"Established by a group of leading foundations — The Pew Charitable Trusts, Oak Foundation, Marisla Foundation (formerly Homeland Foundation), Sandler Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund — after a 1999 study they commissioned discovered that less than 0.5 percent of all resources spent by environmental nonprofit groups in the United States went to ocean advocacy."*

*"No organization was working exclusively to protect and restore the oceans on a global scale. To fill the gap, our founders created Oceana: an international organization focused solely on oceans, dedicated to achieving measurable change by conducting specific, science-based policy campaigns with fixed deadlines and articulated goals."*
